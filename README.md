# Personal Website
A website that displays information about me as well as some of my past projects

www.joshuali.ca

This entire project uses the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). Specifically, this frontend repository is programmed with React.js and Tailwind. The backend respository can be found [here](https://github.com/JoshLiCoding/Personal-Website-Backend) and describes an Express.js server hosted on AWS Elastic Beanstalk. Furthermore, that server fetches data from MongoDB Atlas with links that correspond to images stored on AWS S3.

## Description

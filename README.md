A website that displays information about me as well as some of my past projects

This entire project uses the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). This frontend repository is programmed with React.js and Tailwind. The backend is hosted on Heroku (https://joshli-backend-32dad87846e1.herokuapp.com/projects) and uses an Express.js server that fetches data from MongoDB Atlas.
